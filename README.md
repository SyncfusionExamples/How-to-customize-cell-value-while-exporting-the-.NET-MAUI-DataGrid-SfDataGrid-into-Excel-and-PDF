# How to customize cell value while exporting the .NET MAUI DataGrid SfDataGrid into Excel and PDF
We can tailor a specific cell value during the export of the [SfDataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-datagrid) to Excel and PDF by managing the [DataGridPdfExportingController.CellExporting](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.DataGrid.Exporting.DataGridPdfExportingController.html#Syncfusion_Maui_DataGrid_Exporting_DataGridPdfExportingController_CellExporting) and [DataGridExcelExportingController.CellExporting](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.DataGrid.Exporting.DataGridExcelExportingController.html#Syncfusion_Maui_DataGrid_Exporting_DataGridExcelExportingController_CellExporting) event.

##### Export to PDF:

The following code facilitates the customization of a cell value during the export of the `SfDataGrid` to PDF.

 
 ```XML
DataGridPdfExportingController pdfExport = new DataGridPdfExportingController();
pdfExport.CellExporting += PdfExport_CellExporting;

private void PdfExport_CellExporting(object? sender, DataGridCellPdfExportingEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.CellValue is string &amp;&amp; e.CellValue == "Hannah Arakawa")
    {
        e.CellValue = "Guptill Martin";
    }
}
 ```
 

##### Export to Excel
The provided code allows for the customization of a cell value during the export of the `SfDataGrid` to Excel. Similar to PDF exporting.

 
 ```XML
DataGridExcelExportingController excelExport = new DataGridExcelExportingController();
excelExport.CellExporting += ExcelExport_CellExporting;

private void ExcelExport_CellExporting(object? sender, DataGridCellExcelExportingEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.CellValue is string &amp;&amp; e.CellValue == "Phyllis Allen")
    {
        e.CellValue = "Guptill Martin";
    }
}
 ```
